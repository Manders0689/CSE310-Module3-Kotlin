# CSE310-Module3-Kotlin
# Overview

All of these files are individual programs that showcase my ability to write programs in the Kotlin language.
They show how to use variables, expressions, conditionals, loops, functions, and classes.

# Development Environment

I used IntelliJ on Windows to code all the programs in this file. 

The Kotlin language was used for all programs.

# Future Work

* Make more of the programs take user input from the screen instead of in the code file.
* Separate more of the programs into classes in order to improve functionality.
